# Exercise 3.07: Commitment

I chose to use Postgres with PersistentVolumeClaims.

I actually tried to setup the Google Cloud SQL in an earlier exercise because I couldn't get my postgres working initially. In the end I couldn't get the Google Cloud SQL working either but the postgres started working again on the next day.

Other reason on why I chose PVCs was that it was already almost set up. Also, I feel like I have an opportunity to learn/refresh my memory on databases along this course rather than just outsourcing it to a cloud provider. Of course using the DBaaS would also bring in some valuable experience but as I mentioned already I also played around with it too.
