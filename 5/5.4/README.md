# 5.04 Platform comparison

## OpenShift vs Rancher

I have chosen that the **Rancher** is better and will now list the reasons:
* Rancher is the market leader in open source cloud native Kubernetes management
* Rancher support any certified Kubernetes distribution
* Rancher is 100% open source
* Rancher can manage any cluster, and multiple clusters, not just Rancher created clusters.
* Rancher can be run on any system that has Docker
* Rancher installation is much simpler and faster
* Rancher is easier to upgrade
* Benefits from OpenShift are only achieved if you are already using the Red Hat ecosystem.
